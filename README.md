autojsoncxx
===========
A header-only library and a code generator to **automagically** translate between **JSON** and **C++** types.

JSON is an excellent format for data serialization due to its simplicity, flexibility, portability and human-readable nature. Writing code to parse and generate JSON, however, is not an easy task in a statically typed language even with the help of libraries, especially when you want to retain the advantage of such language, that is, the type checking. *autojsoncxx* is an attempt to automate such process. It is still currently in development, so expect things to change in the future, or it breaks down when your class structure is deeply nested.
