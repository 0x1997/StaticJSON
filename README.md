autojsoncxx
===========
A header-only library and a code generator to **automagically** translate between **JSON** and **C++** types.

## Overview

JSON is an excellent format for data serialization due to its simplicity, flexibility, portability and human-readable nature. Writing code to parse and generate JSON, however, is not an easy task in a statically typed language even with the help of libraries, especially when you want to retain the advantage of such language, that is, the type checking. *autojsoncxx* is an attempt to automate such process. It is still currently in development, so expect things to change in the future, or it breaks down when your class structure is deeply nested.

Dependency: RapidJSON (https://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson)

## First example

The code generator reads a JSON file that defines the class structure. An example definition is like this (remember to fully qualify the type name with its namespace)

```javascript
{
    "name": "Person",
    "members":
    [
        ["unsigned long long", "ID", {"required": true}],
        ["std::string", "name", {"default": "anonymous"}],
        ["double", "height"],
        ["double", "weight"],
        ["std::vector<unsigned long long>", "known_associates"]
    ]
}
```

Run the script *autojsoncxx.py* (requires Python 3) on this definition file, and a header file will be generated. It includes a definition for `Person` as well as some helper classes. The `Person` is a `struct` with all members public, meant as a data holder without any additional functionalities.

```bash
python3 autojsoncxx.py --out=person.hpp def.json
```

Remember to add the include directory of *autojsoncxx* and *rapidjson* to your project header search path (no linking is required). 

The below examples uses c++11 features, but the library also works with c++03 compilers.

### Serialization
```c++
#define AUTOJSONCXX_MODERN_COMPILER 1 
#include <iostream>
#include "person.hpp"

int main()
{
    Person p;
    p.name = "Mike";
    p.ID = 8940220481904ULL;
    p.weight = 70;
    p.height = 1.77;
    p.known_associates = { 149977889346362, 90000134866608, 44412567664 };
    // Use successive push_back() if your compiler is not C++11 ready

    autojsoncxx::to_pretty_json_file("person.json", p);
    return 0;
}
```
This will generate a file `person.json` with contents below:
```javascript
{
    "name": "Mike",
    "ID": 8940220481904,
    "height": 1.77,
    "weight": 70.0,
    "known_associates": [
        149977889346362,
        90000134866608,
        44412567664
    ]
}
```

### Parsing
Now let's try read that back
```c++
#define AUTOJSONCXX_MODERN_COMPILER 1
#include <iostream>
#include "person.hpp"

int main()
{
    autojsoncxx::ParsingResult result;
    Person p;
    if (!autojsoncxx::from_json_file("person.json", p, result)) {
        std::cerr << result << '\n';
        return -1;
    }

    std::cout << "ID: " << p.ID << '\n'
              << "name:  " << p.name << '\n'
              << "height: " << p.height << '\n'
              << "weight: " << p.weight << '\n';

    std::cout << "known associates: ";
    for (auto&& id : p.known_associates)
        std::cout << id << '\t';
    std::cout << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```
### Error handling
If the JSON file is malformed, any decent JSON library will detect it and tell you what goes wrong. But what if the JSON value is perfectly valid, but not layed out the way you expected? Usually you have to manually check the DOM tree against your specification, but this library will automatically generates the necessary code <sub><sup>this library bypasses the DOM construction in both parsing and serialization by using the Stream API of rapidjson</sup></sub>.

Here is valid JSON file

```js
{
    "name": "Mike",
    "ID": 8940220481904,
    "height": 1.77,
    "weight": 70.0,
    "known_associates": [
        "Jack", "Mary"
    ]
}
```

Running through the parsing code, and you will get an error output:

```
Parsing failed at offset 127 with error code 16:
Terminate parsing due to Handler error.

Trace back (last call first):
(*) Type mismatch between expected type "uint64_t" and actual type "string"
(*) Error at array element with index 0
(*) Error at object member with name "known_associates"
```
